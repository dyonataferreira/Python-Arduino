# Python-Arduino
Simple code to start to use Python with Arduino. Two buttons in a scrim using tkinter that control 2 leds: ON - OFF each one.

## Purpose
Searching for a simple and functional code in python to control my Arduino, i realized i didn't found anything that make me satisfied to use in my project, so i decided to make a "start" code by my own. Simple and functional.

## Installation
Obs.: You need to already have Python installed in your computer

This project use three libraries. We will use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install our libraries.

Win + R, write 'CMD' and press enter. And you'll write those commands to install:

1. Pyfirmata
```bash
pip install pyfirmata
```

2. Time (already in Python)

3. tkinter
```bash
pip install tkinter
```
